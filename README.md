# TwinCAT HMI Drag and Drop

This repository provides an example of implementing drag-and-drop functionality within Beckhoff's TwinCAT HMI framework.  
The project demonstrates how to create interactive HMI interfaces that allow users to drag and drop elements, enhancing the user experience in industrial automation applications.

## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Enables users to move elements within the HMI dynamically.
- **Custom Controls**: Showcases the creation of custom HMI controls tailored to specific application needs.
- **Integration with TwinCAT PLC**: Demonstrates seamless communication between the HMI and TwinCAT PLC for real-time data exchange.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [TwinCAT 3 Engineering Environment](https://www.beckhoff.com/en-us/products/automation/twincat/texxxx-twincat-3-engineering/te2000.html)
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and HTML for HMI development.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DiegoCAntunes/TwincatHMI_DragAndDrop.git
   ```

2. **Open the Project**:
   - Launch TwinCAT 3 Engineering.
   - Open the `DragAndDrop.sln` solution file located in the cloned repository.

3. **Build and Deploy**:
   - Build the solution to compile the HMI project.
   - Deploy the HMI to your target device or local machine.

## Usage

Once deployed, the HMI will display an interface with draggable elements.  
Users can interact with these elements to move them around the screen.  
This functionality can be extended to control or monitor specific processes within your automation system.
